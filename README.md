# AR Music App
An application that innovatively combines marker-based Augmented reality with music to get an interesting user experience.  
Only a camera, the cutouts of markers and access to the internet is required in order to use the app.

## How it works?
* User gets to choose which instruments or vocals of a song to listen to and which one to ignore simply by showing the corresponding markers in the camera. 
* Images of corresponding instruments on markers are digitally superimposed using marker-based AR.  
* Only the instruments(markers) detected by the camera will be played, and rest will be muted. 
* All four markers combined makes up the whole song.
